# Simple Shell

Simple Shell project

## Description

This project is about using all we learned in Holberton School during the trimester to create our own version of a Shell.

### Synopsis

This version can be run both directly using:

```
./hsh
```
Or indirectly by piping outupt to it using:

```
"command" | ./hsh
```

### Environment

The project has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.

## Repo contents

All source code files and their description.

### How to use

After executing the simple Shell with

```
./hsh
```
Start typing any command needed just like when using the usual Shell. For example the ls command:

```
ls -la
```
